juniper devices, so we regurarly had to connect to the juniper devices to expose ports and
configure diffent things in the network. This resulted in massive savings because in our data
centers we could setup a dev and staging kubernetes cluster, and we began to only run prod
in the cloud which led to massive savings. `
